# MultiWiSE_Metrics_Manuscript
Code and data associated with Cleland et al. 2025: Multiyear Wildfire Smoke Exposure (MultiWiSE) metrics: A data-driven approach to characterizing episodic PM2.5 exposures for epidemiologic research on chronic health effects

## Code
The script used to generate the MultiWiSE metrics for BC census subdivisions for 2010-2023 can be found in 'Code.' The script allows for replication of the results included in the manuscript, including the step by step process used to process the 2010-2023 BC dissemination area-level daily PM2.5 data, generate weekly estimates of wildfire smoke (WFS) and non-WFS PM2.5, and calculate the 12 MultiWiSE Metrics for all census subdivisions in the province. It also includes code to generate the figures and tables included in the manuscript. 

## Data
The data (BC dissemination area-level daily PM2.5 estimates from CanOSSEM for 2010-2023) needed to replicate the results included in the manuscript can be found in 'Data.'

## Results
The primary results include two .csv files, along with a data dictionary for the files:
1.	File of CSD-Level MultiWiSE Metrics (BC_CSD_MultiWiSE_Metrics_2010-2023.csv)
2.	File of CSD-Level Weekly PM2.5 Estimates (BC_CSD_Weekly_PM25_Episode_Estimates_2010-2023.csv)
